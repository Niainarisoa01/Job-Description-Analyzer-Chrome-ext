# Profile Update Fix

## Issue

The extension was encountering errors when trying to update user profiles in Supabase. The error occurred in the `handleProfileSubmit` function when calling `supabaseService.updateUserProfile()`.

## Root Causes

After investigation, we identified several potential issues:

1. The Supabase client might not be properly initialized when trying to update the profile
2. The `profiles` table might not exist in the Supabase database
3. Row Level Security (RLS) policies might be preventing the user from updating their profile
4. The user ID might be invalid or the user might not exist in the database

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging

We added comprehensive error logging to both the `updateUserProfile` method in `supabase.ts` and the `handleProfileSubmit` function in `settings.ts`. This includes:

- Detailed logging of user data and function calls
- Specific error handling for different types of errors (network, permissions, etc.)
- JSON stringification of objects for better debugging
- Stack trace logging for errors

### 2. Multiple Profile Update Strategies

We implemented multiple strategies for updating profiles to handle different scenarios:

- **Direct Insert**: Attempts to insert a new profile record
- **Standard Update**: Updates an existing profile record
- **RPC Upsert**: Uses a SQL function to handle the upsert operation

### 3. Supabase Initialization Improvements

We improved the Supabase initialization process:

- Added a check for Supabase credentials before attempting profile updates
- Added a delay after initialization to ensure the client is ready
- Reinitialized Supabase before profile updates to ensure a fresh connection

### 4. Database Schema and Functions

We created SQL migrations to ensure the database has the correct schema and functions:

- Created a `create_profiles_table` function to ensure the table exists with the correct structure
- Created an `upsert_profile` function to handle profile upserts at the database level
- Added proper RLS policies to allow users to update their own profiles

### 5. UI Improvements

We improved the user interface during profile updates:

- Added loading state to the submit button
- Improved error messages to be more specific about what went wrong
- Added a finally block to ensure the button state is always reset

## How to Test

1. Log in to the extension
2. Go to the Profile tab
3. Enter a name in the Full Name field
4. Click Save Profile
5. Check the browser console for detailed logs
6. Verify that the profile was updated successfully

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error logs
2. Verify that the Supabase credentials are correct
3. Check if the `profiles` table exists in your Supabase database
4. Run the SQL migrations in the `supabase/migrations` directory
5. Try using the `upsert_profile` function directly in the Supabase SQL Editor
